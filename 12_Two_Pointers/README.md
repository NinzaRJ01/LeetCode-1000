# Two Pointers Technique

## Introduction
The Two Pointers technique is an algorithmic pattern that uses two pointers to traverse an array or sequence in a specific way, often moving them towards each other or in the same direction at different speeds.

## Types
1. Opposite Direction (left and right)
2. Same Direction (slow and fast)
3. Multiple Arrays
4. Sliding Window variant
5. Fast and Slow (Floyd's Cycle Detection)

## Common Use Cases
1. Array/String manipulation
2. Linked List cycle detection
3. Palindrome verification
4. Sorted array operations
5. Subarray problems
6. Three Sum and variants

## Time Complexity
- Typical: O(n)
- With sorting: O(n log n)
- Space: Usually O(1)

## Common Patterns
1. Two Sum II (sorted array)
2. Container With Most Water
3. Remove Duplicates
4. Middle of Linked List
5. Cycle Detection
6. Merge Sorted Arrays

## Implementation Techniques
1. Initialize Pointers
2. Movement Rules
3. Termination Conditions
4. Edge Cases Handling
5. Result Collection

## Variations
1. Three Pointers
2. Multiple Pointers
3. Cyclic Sort
4. Dutch National Flag
5. Partition Arrays

## Best Practices
1. Clear Pointer Naming
2. Boundary Checking
3. Movement Logic
4. Exit Conditions
5. Edge Cases
