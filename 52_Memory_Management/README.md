# Memory Management Algorithms

## Introduction
Memory management algorithms handle allocation, deallocation, and organization of memory in computer systems. They ensure efficient use of memory while preventing fragmentation and memory leaks.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Memory Allocation
- First Fit
- Best Fit
- Worst Fit
- Next Fit
- Buddy System

### 2. Garbage Collection
- Mark and Sweep
- Reference Counting
- Copying Collection
- Generational Collection
- Incremental Collection

## Implementation Techniques

### 1. Memory Pools
- Fixed-size Blocks
- Variable-size Blocks
- Slab Allocation
- Object Pools
- Memory Arenas

### 2. Memory Compaction
- Defragmentation
- Memory Coalescing
- Compacting GC
- Memory Moving
- Page Compaction

## Common Problems
1. Memory Fragmentation
   - Internal
   - External
