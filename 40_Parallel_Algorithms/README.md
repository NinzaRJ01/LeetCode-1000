# Parallel Algorithms

## Introduction
Parallel algorithms are designed to take advantage of multiple processors or cores to solve computational problems faster than sequential algorithms. They divide problems into independent subtasks that can be processed simultaneously.

## Basic Concepts
1. Parallelization Strategies
2. Task Decomposition
3. Load Balancing
4. Synchronization
5. Communication Patterns
6. Scalability Metrics

## Types of Parallelism
