# Database Algorithms

## Introduction
Database algorithms focus on efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data in database management systems. They optimize query processing, indexing, and transaction management.

## Core Components

### 1. Query Processing
- Query Optimization
- Query Planning
- Join Algorithms
- Aggregation
- Sorting

### 2. Indexing
- B-Tree
- B+ Tree
- Hash Index
- Bitmap Index
- R-Tree

### 3. Transaction Management
- ACID Properties
- Concurrency Control
- Recovery
- Isolation Levels
- Lock Management

## Common Algorithms

### 1. Join Algorithms
- Nested Loop Join
- Hash Join
- Merge Join
- Index Nested Loop
- Sort-Merge Join

### 2. Query Optimization
- Cost-Based
- Rule-Based
- Statistics-Based
- Plan Caching
- Adaptive Query Processing

## Implementation Techniques

### 1. Storage Management
- Buffer Management
- Page Layout
- Record Format
- File Organization
- Free Space Management

### 2. Concurrency Control
- Two-Phase Locking
- MVCC
- Timestamp Ordering
- Optimistic Control
- Deadlock Detection
