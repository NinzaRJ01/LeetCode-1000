# Distributed Algorithms

## Introduction
Distributed algorithms are designed to run on computer networks where components communicate and coordinate actions by passing messages. They handle challenges like partial failures, asynchrony, and limited local information.

## Core Concepts

### 1. System Models
- Synchronous
- Asynchronous
- Partially Synchronous
- Byzantine
- Crash-Fault Tolerant

### 2. Communication Models
- Message Passing
- Shared Memory
- Remote Procedure Calls
- Publish-Subscribe
- Point-to-Point

## Common Problems

### 1. Consensus
- Paxos
- Raft
- Byzantine Agreement
- Atomic Broadcast
- Leader Election

### 2. Coordination
- Mutual Exclusion
- Barrier Synchronization
- Global State
- Deadlock Detection
- Resource Allocation

## Key Algorithms

### 1. Leader Election
- Ring Algorithm
- Bully Algorithm
- Chang-Roberts
- LCR Algorithm

### 2. Clock Synchronization
- Berkeley Algorithm
- Cristian's Algorithm
- NTP
- Vector Clocks
- Lamport Timestamps
