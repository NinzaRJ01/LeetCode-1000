# Operating System Algorithms

## Introduction
Operating System algorithms manage computer hardware and software resources, providing essential services for computer programs. They handle process management, memory allocation, file systems, and I/O operations.

## Core Components

### 1. Process Management
- Scheduling Algorithms
  - Round Robin
  - Priority Scheduling
  - FCFS
  - SJF
  - Multilevel Queue

- Process Synchronization
  - Mutex
  - Semaphores
  - Monitors
  - Condition Variables

### 2. Memory Management
- Paging
- Segmentation
- Virtual Memory
- Page Replacement
  - LRU
  - FIFO
  - Optimal
  - Clock
  - Second Chance

### 3. File Systems
- File Allocation
  - Contiguous
  - Linked
  - Indexed
