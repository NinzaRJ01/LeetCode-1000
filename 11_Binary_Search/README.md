# Binary Search

## Introduction
Binary Search is a searching algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, eliminating half of the remaining elements with each iteration.

## Types
1. Classic Binary Search
2. Lower Bound
3. Upper Bound
4. Binary Search on Answer
5. Rotated Array Search
6. Matrix Binary Search

## Common Use Cases
1. Sorted Array Search
2. Root Finding
3. Optimization Problems
4. Rate Limiting Problems
5. Database Indexing
6. System Design (Load Balancing)

## Time Complexity
- Search: O(log n)
- Space: O(1) iterative, O(log n) recursive
- Preprocessing (sorting if needed): O(n log n)

## Common Patterns
1. Basic Search
2. Finding Boundaries
3. Peak Finding
4. Rotated Array Search
5. Matrix Search
6. Minimize Maximum

## Implementation Techniques
1. Iterative Implementation
2. Recursive Implementation
3. Template Methods
   - Template #1 (Basic)
   - Template #2 (Advanced)
   - Template #3 (Alternative)

## Common Pitfalls
1. Integer Overflow
2. Infinite Loops
3. Off-by-one Errors
4. Edge Cases
5. Exit Condition

## Advanced Applications
1. Exponential Search
2. Interpolation Search
3. Fractional Cascading
4. Binary Search on Real Numbers
5. Multi-dimensional Binary Search

## Variations
1. Ternary Search
2. Jump Search
3. Exponential Search
4. Fibonacci Search
5. Uniform Binary Search
