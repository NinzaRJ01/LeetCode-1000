# Advanced Trees

## Introduction
Advanced tree data structures extend beyond basic binary trees to provide specialized functionality, improved performance, or specific use cases. These structures often combine multiple tree properties or introduce new balancing techniques.

## Types
1. Self-Balancing Trees
   - AVL Trees
   - Red-Black Trees
   - Splay Trees
   - B-Trees
   - B+ Trees

2. Special Purpose Trees
   - Segment Trees
   - Fenwick Trees
   - Quad Trees
   - K-D Trees
   - R-Trees

3. Multi-way Trees
   - B-Trees
   - Trie
   - Ternary Search Trees
   - M-way Search Trees

## Common Applications
1. Database Indexing
2. File Systems
3. Computational Geometry
4. Geographic Information Systems
5. Network Routing
6. Game Development

## Time Complexity Analysis
### Self-Balancing Trees
- Search: O(log n)
- Insert: O(log n)
- Delete: O(log n)

### Spatial Trees
- Range Query: O(âˆšn + k)
- Nearest Neighbor: O(log n)
- Construction: O(n log n)

## Implementation Considerations
1. Balance Maintenance
2. Rotation Operations
3. Split/Merge Operations
4. Memory Management
5. Cache Efficiency

## Advanced Operations
1. Range Queries
2. Nearest Neighbor Search
3. Spatial Queries
