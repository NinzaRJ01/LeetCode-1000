# Concurrent Data Structures

## Introduction
Concurrent data structures are designed to be safely accessed and modified by multiple threads simultaneously. They ensure thread-safety while maintaining performance and scalability.

## Basic Concepts
1. Thread Safety
2. Atomicity
3. Linearizability
4. Lock-Freedom
5. Wait-Freedom
6. Progress Guarantees

## Common Structures

### 1. Lists and Queues
- Lock-Free Queue
- Michael-Scott Queue
- Skip List
- Linked List
- Priority Queue

### 2. Maps and Sets
- ConcurrentHashMap
- Skip List Map
- Concurrent Skip List Set
- Concurrent Tree Map
- Lock-Free Hash Set

### 3. Synchronization
- Locks
- Semaphores
- Barriers
- Latches
- Condition Variables

## Implementation Techniques

### 1. Locking Strategies
- Fine-grained Locking
- Lock Striping
- Read-Write Locks
- Optimistic Locking
- Lock-Free Algorithms

### 2. Memory Ordering
- Memory Barriers
- Volatile Variables
- Atomic Operations
- Memory Fences
- Happens-Before

## Performance Considerations
1. Contention
2. Cache Coherence
3. False Sharing
4. Memory Ordering
5. Lock Granularity

## Common Problems
1. Race Conditions
2. Deadlocks
3. Livelocks
4. Starvation
5. Priority Inversion

## Best Practices
1. Minimize Contention
2. Use Atomic Operations
3. Avoid Blocking
4. Handle Failures
5. Test Thoroughly

## Applications
1. Operating Systems
2. Database Systems
3. Web Servers
4. Game Engines
5. Real-time Systems

## Advanced Topics
1. Transactional Memory
2. Lock-Free Programming
3. Memory Models
4. Formal Verification
5. Performance Analysis
