# Splay Trees

## Introduction
A Splay Tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree that automatically moves frequently accessed elements closer to the root. This self-adjusting property ensures amortized logarithmic time for all operations.

## Properties
1. Binary Search Tree Property
2. Self-balancing through splaying
3. Recently accessed elements near root
4. No explicit balance criteria
5. Amortized performance guarantees

## Operations
1. Splay (Basic Operation)
   - Zig
   - Zig-Zig
   - Zig-Zag
2. Insert
3. Delete
4. Search
5. Split
6. Join

## Time Complexity
- Access: O(log n) amortized
- Search: O(log n) amortized
- Insert: O(log n) amortized
- Delete: O(log n) amortized
- Space: O(n)

## Common Use Cases
1. Cache Implementation
2. Memory Management
3. Data Compression
4. Network Routing Tables
5. File Systems
6. Database Indexing

## Implementation Details
1. Node Structure
2. Rotation Operations
3. Splaying Process
4. Access Patterns
5. Balance Maintenance

## Advantages
1. Simple Implementation
2. Self-Adjusting
3. Locality of Reference
4. No Balance Information
5. Good Amortized Performance

## Disadvantages
1. Unpredictable Individual Operation Time
2. Not Height-Balanced
3. High Constant Factors
4. Poor Worst-Case Scenarios

## Advanced Applications
1. Working Set Structure
2. Path Compression
3. Dynamic Tree Operations
4. Online Algorithms
5. Sequential Access Optimization
