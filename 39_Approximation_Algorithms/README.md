# Approximation Algorithms

## Introduction
Approximation algorithms find near-optimal solutions to NP-hard optimization problems. They provide guaranteed bounds on the solution quality while maintaining polynomial time complexity.

## Types of Approximation

### 1. Constant Factor
- Solution within constant factor of optimal
- Example: 2-approximation, 3/2-approximation
- Independent of input size
- Examples:
  - Vertex Cover
  - Metric TSP
  - Set Cover

### 2. PTAS (Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme)
- (1 + ε)-approximation for any ε > 0
- Running time polynomial in input size
- Examples:
  - Knapsack
  - Euclidean TSP
  - Maximum Independent Set in Planar Graphs

### 3. FPTAS (Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme)
- Running time polynomial in both input size and 1/ε
- Strongest approximation guarantee
- Examples:
  - Knapsack
  - Flow Shop Scheduling

## Common Problems and Solutions
