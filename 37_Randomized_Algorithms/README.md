# Randomized Algorithms

## Introduction
Randomized algorithms use random choices as part of their logic to solve problems. They often provide simple and efficient solutions where deterministic approaches are complex or inefficient.

## Types

### 1. Las Vegas Algorithms
- Always correct
- Runtime varies
- Examples:
