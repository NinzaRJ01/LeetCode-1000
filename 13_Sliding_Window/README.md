# Sliding Window

## Introduction
The Sliding Window technique is an algorithmic pattern that aims to reduce the use of nested loops in algorithms. It converts two nested loops into a single loop by maintaining a "window" that slides through the data structure.

## Types
1. Fixed Size Window
2. Variable Size Window
3. Dynamic Window
4. Multi-pointer Window
5. String Window

## Common Use Cases
1. Substring Problems
2. Array Subarrays
3. String Matching
4. Maximum/Minimum Subarray
5. Consecutive Sequence
6. Stream Processing

## Time Complexity
- Typical: O(n)
- Space: O(1) to O(k) 
  where k is window size or unique elements

## Common Patterns
1. Maximum Sum Subarray
2. Longest Substring without Repeating Characters
3. Minimum Window Substring
4. Maximum of All Subarrays of Size K
5. Count Occurrences of Anagrams

## Implementation Techniques
1. Window Bounds Management
2. State Tracking
3. Window Expansion
4. Window Contraction
5. Result Updates

## Optimization Methods
1. Hash Map Usage
2. Deque Implementation
3. State Maintenance
4. Early Termination
5. Space Optimization

## Best Practices
1. Clear Window Definition
2. Efficient State Updates
3. Proper Window Movement
4. Edge Cases Handling
5. Result Maintenance
