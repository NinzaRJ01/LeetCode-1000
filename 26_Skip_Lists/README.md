# Skip Lists

## Introduction
Skip Lists are probabilistic data structures that allow for faster search within an ordered sequence of elements. They are built in layers, where the bottom layer is an ordinary ordered linked list, and each higher layer acts as an "express lane" for the lists below.

## Properties
1. Probabilistic Balance
2. Multiple Layers
3. Express Lane Structure
4. Sorted Elements
5. Random Level Generation

## Common Use Cases
1. Database Systems
2. In-memory Sorting
3. Priority Queues
4. Concurrent Data Structures
5. Redis Implementation
6. File Systems

## Time Complexity
- Search: O(log n) average
- Insert: O(log n) average
- Delete: O(log n) average
- Space: O(n) expected

## Implementation Details
1. Node Structure
   - Key/Value
   - Multiple Forward Pointers
   - Level Information
2. Level Generation
3. Search Path
4. Update Vector

## Operations
1. Search
2. Insert
3. Delete
4. Range Query
5. Level Generation
6. List Maintenance

## Advantages
1. Simple Implementation
2. Good Locality
3. Easy Concurrent Implementation
4. Probabilistic Balance
5. No Complex Rotations

## Comparison with Other Structures
1. vs. Balanced Trees
2. vs. Binary Search
3. vs. Hash Tables
4. Memory Usage
5. Implementation Complexity

## Advanced Applications
1. Concurrent Skip Lists
2. Indexing in Databases
3. Range Queries
4. Priority Queue Implementation
5. Memory Efficient Variants
