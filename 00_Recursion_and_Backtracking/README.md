# Recursion and Backtracking

## Introduction
Recursion is a method of solving problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination to solve a computational problem.

## Types of Recursion
1. Direct Recursion
2. Indirect Recursion
3. Tail Recursion
4. Head Recursion
5. Tree Recursion
6. Nested Recursion

## Backtracking Patterns
1. Decision Making
2. State Space Tree
3. Constraint Satisfaction
4. Optimization Problems
5. Enumeration Problems

## Common Problems
1. Recursion
   - Factorial
   - Fibonacci
   - Tower of Hanoi
   - Tree Traversals
   - Divide and Conquer

2. Backtracking
   - N-Queens
   - Sudoku
   - Permutations
   - Subset Sum
   - Hamiltonian Path

## Time Complexity
- Usually exponential O(b^d)
  where b = branching factor
  and d = maximum depth
- Can be optimized with pruning
- Space complexity: O(d) for recursion depth
