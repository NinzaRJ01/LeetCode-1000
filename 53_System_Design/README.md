# System Design Patterns and Algorithms

## Introduction
System design patterns and algorithms focus on creating scalable, reliable, and maintainable distributed systems. They address challenges in large-scale software architecture and design.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Scalability
- Horizontal Scaling
- Vertical Scaling
- Database Sharding
- Load Balancing
- Caching Strategies

### 2. Reliability
- Fault Tolerance
- High Availability
- Disaster Recovery
- Data Replication
- Circuit Breakers

### 3. Performance
- Caching
- CDN
- Database Optimization
- Asynchronous Processing
- Connection Pooling

## Design Patterns

### 1. Architectural Patterns
- Microservices
- Event-Driven
- CQRS
- Saga Pattern
- Circuit Breaker

### 2. Data Patterns
- Database Sharding
- Read Replicas
- Write-Ahead Logging
- Event Sourcing
- ACID vs BASE
