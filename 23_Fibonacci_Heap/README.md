# Fibonacci Heap

## Introduction
A Fibonacci Heap is a collection of heap-ordered trees optimized for amortized performance. It provides better amortized time complexity for several operations compared to binary heaps.

## Properties
1. Minimum element accessible in O(1)
2. Trees are heap-ordered
3. Nodes can have arbitrary number of children
4. Lazy merging and deletion
5. Marked nodes for cascading cuts

## Operations and Complexity
1. Find Minimum: O(1)
2. Insert: O(1)
3. Decrease Key: O(1) amortized
4. Delete: O(log n) amortized
5. Union: O(1)
6. Extract Min: O(log n) amortized

## Implementation Details
1. Node Structure
   - Key
   - Parent pointer
   - Child pointer
   - Sibling pointers
   - Degree
   - Mark bit

2. Heap Structure
   - Root list
   - Minimum pointer
   - Size counter

## Common Use Cases
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. Prim's Algorithm
3. Priority Queues
4. Graph Algorithms
5. Optimization Problems

## Advanced Operations
1. Cascading Cuts
2. Consolidation
3. Link Operation
4. Cut Operation
5. Degree Bounds

## Advantages
