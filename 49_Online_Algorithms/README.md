# Online Algorithms

## Introduction
Online algorithms make decisions without knowledge of future inputs. They must process input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, making irrevocable decisions along the way.

## Characteristics
1. Sequential Processing
2. Immediate Decisions
3. Irrevocable Choices
4. Limited Future Knowledge
5. Competitive Analysis
