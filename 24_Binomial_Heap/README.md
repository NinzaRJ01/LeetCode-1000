# Binomial Heap

## Introduction
A Binomial Heap is a collection of binomial trees that satisfies the minimum-heap property. Each binomial tree has a specific structure and the heap consists of trees with unique orders.

## Properties
1. Collection of Binomial Trees
2. Each tree follows min-heap property
3. Unique tree orders
4. Tree of order k has 2^k nodes
5. Height of order-k tree is k

## Operations
1. Basic Operations
   - Find Minimum: O(log n)
   - Insert: O(log n)
   - Union: O(log n)
   - Extract Min: O(log n)
   - Decrease Key: O(log n)
   - Delete: O(log n)

2. Structure Operations
   - Link Trees
   - Merge Heaps
   - Consolidate Trees

## Implementation Details
1. Node Structure
   - Key
   - Degree
   - Parent pointer
   - Child pointer
   - Sibling pointer

2. Heap Structure
   - Root list
   - Minimum pointer

## Common Use Cases
1. Priority Queues
2. Graph Algorithms
3. System Programming
4. Task Scheduling
5. Event Management

## Advantages
1. Good theoretical bounds
2. Efficient merging
3. Simple implementation
4. Regular structure
5. Predictable performance

## Disadvantages
1. Complex tree management
2. Not cache-efficient
3. Slower than binary heaps
4. Memory overhead

## Advanced Applications
1. Multi-way Merging
2. External Memory Algorithms
3. Parallel Algorithms
4. Network Optimization
5. Resource Allocation
