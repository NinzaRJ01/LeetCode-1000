# B-Trees

## Introduction
B-Trees are self-balancing tree data structures that maintain sorted data and allow searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time. They are optimized for systems that read and write large blocks of data.

## Types
1. B-Tree
2. B+ Tree
3. B* Tree
4. 2-3 Tree
5. 2-3-4 Tree

## Common Use Cases
1. Database Management Systems
2. File Systems
3. Secondary Storage Devices
4. Multilevel Indexing
5. Directory Systems

## Time Complexity
- Search: O(log n)
- Insert: O(log n)
- Delete: O(log n)
- Space: O(n)
- Traverse: O(n)

## Properties
1. All leaves at same level
2. Node size varies between t-1 and 2t-1 keys
3. Non-leaf nodes (except root) have at least t children
4. Root has at least 2 children if not leaf
5. All nodes are at least half full

## Operations
1. Search
2. Insert
3. Delete
4. Split
5. Merge
6. Redistribution

## Implementation Considerations
1. Node Structure
2. Key Distribution
3. Child Pointer Management
4. Splitting/Merging Rules
5. Minimum Degree Selection

## Advantages
1. Balanced Tree Height
2. Optimized for Block Storage
3. High Fanout
4. Good for Range Queries
5. Efficient for Large Datasets
